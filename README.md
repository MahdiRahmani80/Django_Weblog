# Django_Weblog 

Hi guy's 

this is weblog backend source code in **Django** 

My goal is to write a blog app for Android apps. An app with a cool idea

Like a public chat ...

But with two conditions

**1- At least 50 characters in that text should be**

**2- After publishing each message, it should wait 6 minutes until the next message is published**

For example, at 12 o'clock every night until 12:30, no one can leave a message and the message that gets the most likes per day is displayed.

it's interesting ??

Well, these are my ideas right now, maybe many of you do not know !!

Well, the gates of learning are always open ...

Of course, I have good friends like you by my side to help me.
 
Of course, the program I want has other parts as well, such as creating a regular blog !!!

## Instalation guid:

```
git clone https://github.com/MahdiRahmani80/Django_Weblog.git
pip install -r requierments.txt
cd weblog 
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
# open browser and write 127.0.0.1:8000/admin
# set your username and pass
```
